## Finger Pattern Detector
### Introduction
This is a mini project for learning computer vision. It only demonstrates the basic idea of the project without refining all the details.

The detector can detect any finger pattern you created with your hands. It works for single hand and both of your hands. You can even swap the position of your right hand with your left hand, and this detector is smart enough to recognize that.

By now, each finger can have two state, either lifted up or not lifted up. However, it is not hard to add more states of the fingers.
